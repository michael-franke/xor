\noindent \textbf{Exclusive disjunction: implicature or \dots}

\noindent Exclusive readings of disjunctions are frequently treated as a scalar implicature
arising from the competition of lexical alternatives \emph{or} and \emph{and}, parallel to the
case of \emph{some} and \emph{all}. On the other hand, there is recent experimental evidence
for the assumption that the strength of scalar inferences can vary substantially between
different scalar items \citep[e.g.][]{Tielvan-TielMiltenburgvan-Miltenburg2014:Scalar-Diversit}
and be affected by multiple contextual factors in subtle ways
\citep[e.g.][]{Degen2015:Investigating-t}. The main question that we would like to address
experimentally in this paper is therefore: is the strength of exclusive readings of
disjunctions influenced by contextual factors in such a way as a scalar implicature account
would predict?

Many factors may have an effect on the strength of scalar inferences. We will focus on three
factors, for reasons of theoretical interest. Firstly, it should matter whether the scalar
inference is \emph{relevant} information for the listener. Secondly, it matters whether the
speaker is \emph{competent}, i.e., whether it is safe to assume that she knows whether a
stronger alternative statement would be true. Thirdly, although this is not usually explicitly
considered, it is plausible that \emph{prior expectations} would influence the strength of
scalar inferences as well \citep[e.g.][]{DegenTessler2015:Wonky-worlds:-L}. 

Different theoretical positions towards scalar implicatures may relate differently to some of
these factors, but, arguably, most would acknowledge that these factors play a role. For
instance, standard Gricean(-like) reasoning could make relevance of information and the
speaker's competence necessary conditions for the derivation of a scalar implicature, but also
see a role for prior plausibility. A game-theoretic or probabilistic approach might put
particular emphasis on the role of prior expectations instead. When it comes to grammatical
approaches, where scalar implicatures are generated as parses of sentences that feed into some
disambiguation procedure, the relevance of alternatives is often flagged as important, but
it is not strange to think that the disambiguation procedure is sensitive to all three factors
mentioned here as well: for instance, it may weigh in the contextual plausibility of ignorance
inferences that different parses would give rise to
\citep{Fox2007:Free-Choice-and,ChemlaSingh2014:Remarks-on-the-}.

Irrespective of the general theoretical framework adopted, we would therefore expect that
strength of scalar inferences should rise (i) the more contextual relevance is attributed to
the stronger alternative, (ii) the more likely the speaker is taken to know whether the
stronger alternative is true, and (iii) the less likely it is \emph{a priori} that the stronger
alternative is true. If this pattern is empirically confirmed for some scalar inferences, but
not for others that would be surprising, and mild evidence against a homogeneous theoretical
treatment. 

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item the higher the contextual relevance of the information conveyed by the scalar alternative
%   is to the listener, the more salient the scalar inference should be;
% \item the more likely the speaker is thought to know whether the scalar alternative is true,
%   the more strongly the scalar inference should suggest itself;
% \item the less likely the scalar alternative is true, the stronger the scalar implicature
%   should be.
% \end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Experiment 1} In this experiment we tested the effects of relevance, competence and
prior probability on the robustness of exclusive readings. Materials consisted of 16 vignettes
involving two characters $S$ and $H$. Each vignette ended with $S$ uttering a sentence of the
form ``$A$ or $B$.'' Each vignette was associated with five statements: three control
statements and four target statements, which aimed at relevance (``It is important for $H$ to
know whether $A$ and $B$''), competence (``$S$ knows whether $A$ and $B$''), prior probability
(``If $A$, it is likely that $B$ as well'' and ``If $B$, it is likely that $A$ as well''), and
exclusive readings (``From what $S$ said we may conclude that not both $A$ and $B$''). Each
vignette was intuitively classified as either high or low in each of the three factors of
relevance. There were 2 vignettes for each of the 8 possible vignette types, i.e., high/low
factor combinations.

200 participants each read 8 of these vignettes, one of each vignette type. Each vignette was
followed by two questions: one control question and one target question. Participants were
instructed to indicate how likely the statement was and could respond by setting a slider on a
continuous scale ranging from ``Certainly false'' to ``Certainly true.''
Figure~\ref{fig:correlationsExp1} shows the relation of per-vignette mean implicature ratings
and per-vignette mean ratings for the three explanatory factors.

    Experiment~1}
  \label{fig:correlationsExp1}
\end{figure}

We looked at linear regression models whose dependent variable were ratings of the exclusive
reading statements and whose explanatory factors were the by-vignette means of the three
explanatory factors relevance, competence and prior. Comparison of models by Bayes factors
showed that there were two optimal models for predicting the robustness of exclusive readings
that were significantly better than all competitors: one containing only prior probability, and
one containing prior probability and competence. Estimates of the posterior distributions over
model parameter coefficients indicated that both of these factors had significant
effects. Critically, however, the effect of competence went in the opposite direction to what
an implicature-based approach predicts: the perceived robustness of the exclusive reading
\emph{decreased} with the perceived competence of the speaker (see
Figure~\ref{fig:correlationsExp1}). In effect, our analysis and data suggest that the prior
probability of the \emph{and}-alternative is the decisive predictor of exclusive-\emph{or}
strength, and, although it does have a slight explanatory effect, competence of the speaker
influenced strength of exclusive-\emph{or} in the wrong direction.

How to explain the surprising negative effect of competence? Perhaps the most parsimonious explanation would be to attribute it to methodological flaws. That is, perhaps our manipulation did not measure what we assumed it measured. In order to address that possibility we replicated Experiment 1 using vignettes with \emph{some}. 

\paragraph{Experiment 2} The design and procedure of Experiment 3 was analogous to that of Experiment 1 except that we created 16 vignettes that ended with an utterance containing \emph{some} instead of \emph{or}.

Regression model comparison indicated that the optimal model contained prior probability and competence. In the results of this experiment, the role of competence went in the direction predicted by the implicature-based approach. So unlike exhaustive readings, the robustness of upper-bounding inferences associated with \emph{some} increases with the speaker's competence.

Taken together, these findings
