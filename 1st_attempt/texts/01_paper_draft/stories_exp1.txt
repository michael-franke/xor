\noindent \textbf{3. NBA} \emph{(Rel+ / Com+ / Pri--)} \\
Jason Barley and Richard Trellis are TV experts engaged in a live discussion of the current NBA season which is nearing its end. They are debating about whether Greg Jones should be the Most Valuable Player of the season. Jason Barley thinks so, but Richard Trellis is less convinced. Jason Barley says: ``Greg Jones secured victory for his team during the last seconds of some of the decisive playoff matches.''\footnote{\label{fn:NBA_exp1}This item was removed from the analysis. We observed that the average robustness rating for the upper-bounding construal of ``some'' for this item (39\%) was substantially below the corresponding ratings for the other items (58\% or more). In addition, almost half of the participants indicated that the probability of the upper-bounded reading was zero, while none did so for the next lowest scoring item. On closer examination, we noticed an ambiguity in the statement measuring the robustness of the upper-bounding construal:

\ex.	From what Jason Barley said we may conclude that Greg Jones did not secure victory for his team during the last seconds of all of the decisive playoff matches.

This statement may be read as implying that Greg Jones did not secure victory during the last seconds of \emph{any} of the decisive playoff matches, which is is manifestly false. In order to determine if participants indeed succumbed to this ambiguity, we tested an alternative formulation:

\ex.	From what Jason Barley said we may conclude that not all of the decisive playoff matches were secured during the last seconds by Greg Jones.

Importantly, this formulation is equivalent to the desired reading of \LLast but lacks the ambiguity because the negation directly modifies the noun rather than the verb phrase.

We presented 40 participants on Mechanical Turk with the NBA story, followed by three questions. The first two were control questions. The third one was the target question. Half of the participants saw \LLast and the other half \Last. The procedure was the same as in the original experiment, except that responses were made by marking a value on a seven-point scale rather than by means of a continuous slider. The results for the formulation in \LLast (28\%) were in line with the results of the original experiment (39\%). However, the results for the formulation in \Last were significantly higher (66\%, $t$(29) = 4.28, $p$ $<$ .001), thus indicating that participants did not arrive at the desired reading of \LLast. Hence, we decided to remove this item from the analysis.}\\
