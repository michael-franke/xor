# TODO



## Stela

- show initial example on separate screen (first instructions, then click to example) **done**

- Headline "Begin Experimet" -> "ExperimeNt" **done**

- if the statement to be rated spans several lines, have the red question mark top aligned with the first line **done**

- for the prior conditions, there should be no utterance (we never use "utterance_disj1" or "utterance_disj2") in this experiment **done**

- highlight the statement in the XOR block: e.g. make it part of the background story; bold text; and a slightly darker background box within the light gray box? **done**

- progress bar: e.g., total 75%; question 4 out of 8 in block 3 out of 4 **done**

- record user equipment info (browser, device, OS, ...) **done**

- record RTs **done**

- replace question_or with quesiton_imp in vignettes_or.js **done**

- fix PRI block to show 2 pri question for 'or' items and 1 for 'some' items **done**

- include instructions between blocks (MF will write these) **partially done**

- fix format of output data: see -> xor/1st_attempt/analyses & data/01_xor-main/data2.csv 


## Michael

- write instructions between blocks (mention introduction of statement in XOR block!)

- double check all vignettes (new control questions!)

- add more vignettes?



## Bob

- double check all vignettes (new control questions!)

- add more vignettes?
